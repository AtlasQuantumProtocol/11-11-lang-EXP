 11/11 Language EXP — Public Demo

This repository is a public demonstration of the 11/11 Language architecture: a security-first execution model built for long-horizon systems where auditability and governance are not optional.

It is designed to show how modern languages should be structured when:
- trust matters
- determinism matters
- system boundaries matter
- compliance and traceability matter
