 11/11 Language EXP — Overview (Public Demo)

11/11 Language EXP is a public demonstration of the 11/11 Language concept: a security-first, audit-first execution model designed for long-horizon computing and high-assurance systems.

This repository is intentionally structured to show:
- how the language pipeline is organized
- how audit and security concerns are represented at the architecture level
- how systems integrate through interfaces without exposing proprietary implementations

**Important:** This repo is a demo. It does not include proprietary compiler internals or production security implementations.
