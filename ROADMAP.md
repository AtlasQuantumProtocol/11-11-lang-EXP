 11/11 Language EXP — Public Roadmap (Conceptual)

This roadmap describes conceptual direction only for the 11/11 Language and related systems.

It is provided to help observers understand where the architecture is going, not how it is implemented.



 Phase 1 — Public Demonstration (Current)

Status: ✅ Active

Goals:
- Provide a public-safe demo repository
- Demonstrate language pipeline structure
- Show correct separation of concerns
- Establish governance and IP boundaries

Deliverables:
- Stub compiler pipeline
- Demo CLI
- Example `.111` programs
- Public documentation
- Guardrail enforcement tests



 Phase 2 — Expanded Language Semantics (Conceptual)

Status: 🔒 Proprietary (Not in this repo)

Conceptual focus:
- richer execution semantics
- stronger correctness guarantees
- deeper integration with audit systems
- policy-aware execution models

Note:
Implementation details are proprietary and not included in public repositories.


 Phase 3 — Secure Runtime Integration (Conceptual)

Status: 🔒 Proprietary

Conceptual focus:
- hardened execution environments
- controlled interaction with external systems
- formal verification hooks
- deterministic replay and inspection

Public posture:
- described architecturally only
- no runtime internals published



 Phase 4 — Ecosystem and Tooling (Conceptual)

Status: 🔒 Proprietary

Conceptual focus:
- developer tooling
- static analysis
- audit visualization
- system governance dashboards



 What This Roadmap Is NOT

This roadmap does not:
- promise delivery dates
- expose implementation details
- describe production timelines
- grant rights to future work

It exists to show architectural intent and long-term vision only.



 Governance

All roadmap execution, prioritization and implementation decisions are governed internally by:

11 AI Blockchain Developments LLC (Wyoming)

Public repositories will continue to be used **only** for safe demonstrations and documentation.
